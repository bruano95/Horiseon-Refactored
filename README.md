# Code Refactor
Improving HTML semantics and accessibility, and optimizing CSS within the given code.

## Description
The goal of this application is to ensure proper HTML semantics are included while the CSS code is condensed. The original code included non-semantic elements. By changing these elements the code is properly structured. These changes within the HTML semantics helped allow for changes within the CSS. The modifications were made to create a more condesed CSS code by combining similar necessities of multiple items. By changing the semantics and CSS code the outcome and display of the application did not change and is displayed as the screenshot below.
